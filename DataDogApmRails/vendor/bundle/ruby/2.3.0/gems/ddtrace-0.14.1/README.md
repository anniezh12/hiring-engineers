``ddtrace`` is Datadogâ€™s tracing client for Ruby. It is used to trace requests as they flow across web servers,
databases and microservices so that developers have great visiblity into bottlenecks and troublesome requests.

## Development

### Testing

Configure your environment through:

    $ bundle install
    $ appraisal install

You can launch tests using the following Rake commands:

    $ rake test:main                                      # tracer tests
    $ appraisal rails<version>-<database> rake test:rails # tests Rails matrix
    $ appraisal contrib rake test:redis                   # tests Redis integration
    ...

Run ``rake --tasks`` for the list of available Rake tasks.
Run ``appraisal list`` for the list of available appraisals.

The test suite requires many backing services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, ...) and we're using
``docker`` and ``docker-compose`` to start these services in the CI.
To launch properly the test matrix, please [install docker][2] and [docker-compose][3] using
the instructions provided by your platform. Then launch them through:

    $ docker-compose up -d

We also enforce the Ruby [community-driven style guide][1] through Rubocop. Simply launch:

    $ rake rubocop
